# **Linux Folder Structure**

The Linux filesystem is organized in a hierarchical, tree-like structure starting from the **root directory** (`/`). Unlike other operating systems, Linux uses a single unified directory structure, where all files, directories, and even devices are organized under `/`. The **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)** defines the purpose of key directories, ensuring consistency across Linux distributions. Understanding this structure is essential for locating configuration files, logs, executables, and user data on a server.

## **Key Concepts**

- **Root Directory (**`/`**)**: The top-level directory, containing all other directories and files.
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Directories are nested, and paths are written as `/path/to/directory` (e.g., `/etc/nginx`).
- **Case Sensitivity**: Linux filenames and paths are case-sensitive (e.g., `File.txt` ≠ `file.txt`).
- **Everything is a File**: In Linux, directories, devices, and even sockets are treated as files.
- **Practical Use**: Knowing the folder structure helps you navigate, configure services, and troubleshoot issues.

## **Core Directories and Their Purposes**

Below is a breakdown of the most important directories in the Linux filesystem, their roles, and practical examples.

### 1. `/` (Root Directory)

- **Purpose**: The top-level directory, the starting point of the filesystem.
- **Contents**: Contains all other directories and files.
- **Practical Insight**:
  - Use `ls /` to list top-level directories.
  - Avoid cluttering `/` with custom files; use appropriate subdirectories instead.
- **Example**: Running `cd /` takes you to the root directory.

### 2. `/bin` (Binaries)

- **Purpose**: Stores essential executable binaries (commands) available to all users.
- **Contents**: Core utilities like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`, and `bash`.
- **Practical Insight**:
  - These are critical for basic system operation, especially in single-user or recovery mode.
  - Check contents: `ls /bin`.
- **Example**: The `ls` command you run is located in `/bin/ls`.

### 3. `/sbin` (System Binaries)

- **Purpose**: Contains system administration binaries, typically used by the root user.
- **Contents**: Tools like `fdisk`, `ifconfig`, `reboot`, and `iptables`.
- **Practical Insight**:
  - Requires elevated privileges (`sudo`) to run most commands.
  - Use `ls /sbin` to explore system tools.
- **Example**: Run `sudo /sbin/reboot` to restart the server.

### 4. `/etc` (Configuration Files)

- **Purpose**: Stores system-wide configuration files for services and applications.
- **Contents**: Files like `/etc/fstab` (filesystem table), `/etc/passwd` (user accounts), and `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` (Nginx config).
- **Practical Insight**:
  - Edit configs with a text editor like `nano` or `vim` (e.g., `sudo nano /etc/fstab`).
  - Always back up configs before modifying: `sudo cp /etc/file /etc/file.bak`.
  - Key for server setup (e.g., configuring SSH in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`).
- **Example**: To configure a web server, edit `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` on Ubuntu.

### 5. `/home` (User Home Directories)

- **Purpose**: Contains home directories for regular users, where they store personal files and settings.
- **Contents**: Subdirectories named after users (e.g., `/home/john`, `/home/alice`).
- **Practical Insight**:
  - Each user’s home directory contains files like `~/.bashrc` (shell config) and `~/Documents`.
  - The root user’s home is `/root`, not in `/home`.
  - Check your home directory: `echo $HOME`.
- **Example**: A user’s SSH keys are stored in `/home/username/.ssh/`.

### 6. `/root` (Root User’s Home)

- **Purpose**: The home directory for the root user.
- **Contents**: Configuration files and data specific to the root user (e.g., `~/.bashrc` for root).
- **Practical Insight**:
  - Access requires root privileges: `sudo -i` or `sudo ls /root`.
  - Avoid storing large files here; use `/home` for regular users.
- **Example**: Root’s bash history is in `/root/.bash_history`.

### 7. `/var` (Variable Data)

- **Purpose**: Stores data that changes during system operation, such as logs, databases, and web content.
- **Key Subdirectories**:
  - `/var/log`: System and application logs (e.g., `/var/log/syslog`, `/var/log/apache2/error.log`).
  - `/var/www`: Web server content (e.g., `/var/www/html` for Apache/Nginx).
  - `/var/lib`: Application state data (e.g., `/var/lib/mysql` for MySQL databases).
  - `/var/spool`: Queued data (e.g., `/var/spool/mail` for emails).
- **Practical Insight**:
  - Monitor logs for troubleshooting: `tail -f /var/log/syslog`.
  - Check disk usage in `/var`: `du -sh /var/*`.
  - Critical for server monitoring and debugging.
- **Example**: View web server errors: `cat /var/log/nginx/error.log`.

### 8. `/tmp` (Temporary Files)

- **Purpose**: Stores temporary files created by applications or users.
- **Contents**: Files that are typically deleted on reboot or by cleanup scripts.
- **Practical Insight**:
  - Safe to use for short-term storage: `touch /tmp/testfile`.
  - Avoid storing critical data here, as it may be cleared automatically.
  - Check permissions: `ls -l /tmp` (usually writable by all users).
- **Example**: A script might create `/tmp/output.txt` during execution.

### 9. `/usr` (User Programs and Data)

- **Purpose**: Contains user-installed programs, libraries, and documentation.
- **Key Subdirectories**:
  - `/usr/bin`: Non-essential user binaries (e.g., `python`, `git`).
  - `/usr/sbin`: Non-essential system binaries (e.g., `sshd`).
  - `/usr/lib`: Libraries for user programs.
  - `/usr/share`: Shared data like documentation and icons.
  - `/usr/local`: Software installed manually or not managed by the package manager.
- **Practical Insight**:
  - Most software installed via package managers (e.g., `apt`, `dnf`) goes here.
  - Check installed binaries: `ls /usr/bin`.
  - Use `/usr/local` for custom-compiled software to avoid conflicts.
- **Example**: The `vim` editor is typically in `/usr/bin/vim`.

### 10. `/lib` and `/lib64` (Libraries)

- **Purpose**: Stores shared libraries required by binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`.
- **Contents**: Dynamic libraries (e.g., `libc.so`) and kernel modules (e.g., `/lib/modules`).
- **Practical Insight**:
  - Check library dependencies for a binary: `ldd /bin/ls`.
  - `/lib64` is used for 64-bit libraries on some systems.
  - Critical for running applications; missing libraries cause errors.
- **Example**: The `libc` library in `/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so` supports core functions.

### 11. `/opt` (Optional Software)

- **Purpose**: Stores optional or third-party software not managed by the package manager.
- **Contents**: Self-contained applications (e.g., `/opt/google/chrome`).
- **Practical Insight**:
  - Common for proprietary software or custom installations.
  - Check contents: `ls /opt`.
  - Ensure proper permissions when installing software here.
- **Example**: Install a custom app: `sudo tar -xzf app.tar.gz -C /opt`.

### 12. `/boot` (Boot Loader Files)

- **Purpose**: Contains files required for the system to boot, including the kernel and bootloader config.
- **Contents**: Kernel images (e.g., `vmlinuz`), initrd images, and GRUB config (`/boot/grub/grub.cfg`).
- **Practical Insight**:
  - Be cautious when modifying; errors can prevent booting.
  - Check kernel versions: `ls /boot`.
  - Monitor disk space, as `/boot` can fill up with old kernels.
- **Example**: Update GRUB settings in `/etc/default/grub` and regenerate: `sudo update-grub`.

### 13. `/dev` (Device Files)

- **Purpose**: Contains special files representing hardware devices and virtual devices.
- **Contents**: Files like `/dev/sda` (disk), `/dev/null` (null device), `/dev/random` (random number generator).
- **Practical Insight**:
  - Devices are treated as files: `ls /dev`.
  - Use `lsblk` to list block devices (e.g., disks, partitions).
  - Critical for storage and hardware management.
- **Example**: Write to a disk: `sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=1M count=100`.

### 14. `/proc` (Process Information)

- **Purpose**: A virtual filesystem providing information about running processes and system status.
- **Contents**: Pseudo-files like `/proc/cpuinfo` (CPU details), `/proc/meminfo` (memory usage), and `/proc/<pid>` (process info).
- **Practical Insight**:
  - Not stored on disk; generated dynamically by the kernel.
  - Useful for monitoring: `cat /proc/cpuinfo`.
  - Explore process details: `ls /proc/<pid>`.
- **Example**: Check memory usage: `cat /proc/meminfo`.

### 15. `/sys` (System Information)

- **Purpose**: A virtual filesystem exposing kernel and device information.
- **Contents**: Details about hardware, drivers, and kernel settings (e.g., `/sys/class`, `/sys/devices`).
- **Practical Insight**:
  - Used for advanced system monitoring and configuration.
  - Check hardware info: `ls /sys/class`.
  - Requires root for some operations.
- **Example**: View CPU frequency: `cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq`.

### 16. `/mnt` and `/media` (Mount Points)

- **Purpose**:
  - `/mnt`: Temporary mount points for filesystems (e.g., external drives).
  - `/media`: Mount points for removable media (e.g., USB drives, CDs).
- **Contents**: Mounted filesystems (e.g., `/media/user/USB`).
- **Practical Insight**:
  - Mount a drive: `sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt`.
  - Check mounted filesystems: `df -h` or `lsblk`.
  - `/media` is typically managed automatically for removable devices.
- **Example**: Access a USB drive: `ls /media/username`.

## **Practical Tips for Navigating and Using the Folder Structure**

1. **Navigation Commands**:
   - List directory contents: `ls -l` (detailed) or `ls -a` (show hidden files).
   - Change directory: `cd /etc` or `cd ~` (home directory).
   - View current directory: `pwd`.
   - Find files: `find / -name "filename"` or `locate filename` (faster, requires `updatedb`).
2. **Permissions**:
   - Check permissions: `ls -l /etc` (shows `rwxr-xr-x` format).
   - Modify permissions: `sudo chmod 644 /etc/myfile`.
   - Change ownership: `sudo chown user:group /home/user/file`.
3. **Disk Usage**:
   - Check space: `df -h` (human-readable).
   - Analyze directory size: `du -sh /var/*`.
   - Monitor `/var`, `/tmp`, and `/boot` to prevent disk space issues.
4. **Troubleshooting**:
   - Logs in `/var/log` are your first stop for errors (e.g., `tail -f /var/log/syslog`).
   - Check `/proc` and `/sys` for system diagnostics.
   - Verify configs in `/etc` for service issues.
5. **Best Practices**:
   - Respect the FHS: Place files in the correct directories (e.g., configs in `/etc`, logs in `/var/log`).
   - Avoid modifying `/boot` or `/dev` unless necessary.
   - Use `/usr/local` or `/opt` for custom software to avoid conflicts with package managers.
